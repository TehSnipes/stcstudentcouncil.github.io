Hi, Eugene here. With our IGCSE exams out of the way, Kevin and I have begun to work on the Chartwells food ordering system.

Right now we've made two repositories on GitHub - one for the actual code, and one for this blog which will contain future updates for our food-ordering system. Furthermore, we are currently working on the flow-chart for the ordering system - more details on that (the flow-chart) will be up here soon.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
