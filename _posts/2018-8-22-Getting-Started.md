We’re back! School just started and we’re getting back on track with the project. For those of you who aren’t too sure what this project is, in short, we’re reforming the way students get their food. As an attempt to shorten cafeteria lines, we’re designing an online pre-ordering system that allows everyone at STC to order their food a day ahead. 

Currently, we’ve produced Gantt charts for both of us. Basically, this is a rudimentary idea of our time plan; please do not take this as a finalized timetable of hard deadlines, this chart is just going to plot out the general trajectory our project will proceed through:

As you can see, this project will occur over a span of 32 weeks. Kevin will be responsible for the front-end aspect of the system (HTML/CSS/JS), while Eugene will be responsible for the back-end aspect of the system (Django, a Python framework), and will also connect the front-end part with the back-end part.

In case you’re wondering, the “Backup Time for Frontend” row for Eugene are “backup weeks” in case Kevin hasn’t finished his frontend by the time Eugene finishes his backend. During this time, Eugene could do other things such as:

* Help Kevin on the front-end part
* Brainstorm and create flow-charts/specifications for new ideas (e.g a rating system)

As of now the flowchart is still in progress - but you can have a screenshot of what we have now :)

If you have experience in coding or designing and want to help out, feel free to contact us via our school email (type Eugene Lau or Kevin Do Cao in the school email "To" box and our respective addresses should pop up) and we’ll respond to you as soon as possible!
